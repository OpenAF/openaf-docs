## Installing/Setup

### Docker

````bash
docker run --pull always --rm -ti openaf/oaf
# ./oafc
````

> For more options for the OpenAF container images check the [container images](docs/concepts/container-images.md) page.

## Single file download

Download the specific file for your OS and architecture (see below for Windows):

| OS | Architecture | Link |
|------------------|----|--------------|
| Linux | x86_64 (Intel) | [openaf.io/oaf-linux-x86_64](https://openaf.io/oaf-linux-x86_64) |
| Linux | aarch64 (Arm) | [openaf.io/oaf-linux-aarch64](https://openaf.io/oaf-linux-aarch64) |
| Alpine Linux | x86_64 (Intel) | [openaf.io/oaf-alpine-x86_64](https://openaf.io/oaf-alpine-x86_64) |
| Alpine Linux | aarch64 (Arm) | [openaf.io/oaf-alpine-aarch64](https://openaf.io/oaf-alpine-aarch64) |
| Mac | x64_64 (Intel) | [openaf.io/oaf-mac-x86_64](https://openaf.io/oaf-mac-x86_64) |
| Mac | aarch64 (Apple Silicon) | [openaf.io/oaf-mac-aarch64](https://openaf.io/oaf-mac-aarch64) |


After downloading the file, execute:

```bash
chmod u+x oaf-*
./oaf-*
# Please use the created symlinks: oaf, ojob, opack, oafc, oafp, oaf-sb or ojob-sb
# ./oafc
``` 

This will provide it with execution permissons and, afterwards, simply execute it.

For a more permanent or portable install follow the next instructions.

### Windows

````
C:\> mkdir oaf
C:\> cd oaf
C:\oaf> curl https://openaf.io/install.bat -o install.bat
C:\oaf> install.bat
C:\oaf> oafc
````

### Linux

````bash
# With sudo
curl https://openaf.io/install.sh | sh
# oafc

# Without sudo
curl https://openaf.io/setup.sh | sh && cd oaf
# ./oafc

# With an existing java JRE/JDK >= 21
curl https://ojob.io/get.sh | sh && cd oaf
# ./oafc
````

If you don't have _sudo_, _curl_ or _wget_ but you do have bash you can just execute the following command or [follow these instructions](docs/howto/Download-without-curl-or-wget.md):

```bash
# With just bash
/bin/bash -c "exec 3<>/dev/tcp/ojob.io/80 && echo -e \"GET /get.sh HTTP/1.1\nHost: ojob.io\nUser-Agent: curl\nConnection: close\n\n\" >&3 && cat <&3" | sed '1,/connection: close/d' | tail -n +2 | sh -s
```

### Mac OS

````bash
curl -o setup.sh https://openaf.io/setup.sh && sh setup.sh && rm setup.sh && mv oaf /Applications/OpenAF && sudo sh -c "echo "/Applications/OpenAF" > /etc/paths.d/OpenAF"
# oafc
````

## Move to a different folder

If you used "install.sh": After moving to the new folder execute the reinstall.sh (or reinstall.bat in Windows) created after the first installation.

If you used "setup.sh": Simple move the folder.

## Upgrade

After installing an update.sh (or update.bat in Windows) will be created. Simply execute it.

## Uninstall

### Linux

````bash
sudo ojob ojob.io/oaf/symlinks UNINSTALL=true && sudo rm -rf /opt/oaf
````

### Mac OS

````
rm -rf /Applications/OpenAF && sudo rm /etc/paths/OpenAF && rm ~/.openaf*
````

### Windows

Simply delete the created folder ([current folder]/oaf or c:\\oaf)
